Drought occurs as a result of little or no rainfall over a certain period of time in a particular area. It is a recurring and pervasive environmental challenge that affects numerous African countries. As the 21st century progresses, understanding the evolving patterns of drought and its consequences has become increasingly important. This comparative analysis seeks to provide insights into the distribution, severity, and impacts of drought in African nations during the 21st century. By examining available data, we aim to shed light on the changing dynamics of drought and the measures taken to address its effects.

The aim of this analysis is to comprehensively analyze the distribution, severity and impacts of drought in African countries since the beginning of the 21st century. By comparing and contrasting these aspects across regions and time, the research seeks to provide valuable insights into the evolving nature of drought in Africa.
